    <h1>National Voter File</h1>
    <p>We provide an easy-to-use, modern-era database with voter files for each of the fifty states. It uses a data model that represents a national voter file as well as associated campaign measures in a shared data warehouse.</p>
    <p>We want to pull politics into the 21st century, and we're starting from the ground up.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™re fully open-source and we would love <a href="https://github.com/getmovement/national-voter-file">your help</a>.</p>
